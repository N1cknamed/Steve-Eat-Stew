# Steve Eat Stew
Steve Eat Stew is a WIP Fabric mod that rebalances the vanilla food options in Minecraft.

### Stews, soups, cake and honey bottles can stack to 64
Inventory management is awful enough without also having to manage your food supply. Rabbit stew takes its rightful place at the top of the _food chain_. Did you know cake has been stackable on Bedrock edition since forever? How's that parity update looking, Mojang?

### Edible glistering melon slice and sugar
Food is food, and these items are definitely food. Maybe now you'll remember glistering melon exists.

### Varied eating durations
Dried kelp shouldn't be the only quick snack, and Steve should take it easy on the melon pie.

### Milk has nutritional value
Especially a full bucket of the stuff.

### Planned features:
- Config options
- Cake eating sounds/particles
- Potion Stacking (maybe)

### Won't add:
- New types of food
- Changes to how the hunger system works
- Suspicious stew stacking (wouldn't work due to the different effects)
