# Steve Eat Stew
Steve Eat Stew is a simple Fabric mod that rebalances the vanilla food options in Minecraft to give the player more varied options.

### Features:
- Stews, soups, cake and honey bottles can stack to 64, making them much more viable
- Many foods get unique eating times (similar to dried kelp) to differentiate them from each other more
- Edible glistering melon slice and sugar add some new options to pick from

### Planned features:
- Config options
- Cake eating sounds/particles
- Potion Stacking (maybe)

### Won't add:
- New types of food
- Changes to how the hunger system works
- Suspicious stew stacking (wouldn't work due to the different effects)
